# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Do not use excessive emojis anywhere.

## Architecture

The app is a thin Electron shell over a PyInstaller-bundled Python CLI. There is no long-running Python service — every operation is a subprocess invocation.

- **Electron main (`app/main.js`, ~6.2k lines)** owns the UI window, tray, deep-link protocol, and orchestrates everything via `ipcMain.handle(...)`. Handlers shell out to the bundled backend through `getBackendPath()` → `process.resourcesPath/stenoai/stenoai` (or `dist/stenoai/stenoai` in dev) using `child_process.spawn`.
- **Renderer (`app/renderer/`)** is a Vite-built React + TypeScript SPA. Runs with `contextIsolation: true` and talks to the main process exclusively through the typed bridge in `app/preload.js` → `ipc()` (`app/renderer/src/lib/ipc.ts`). Built output lives at `app/renderer/dist/index.html` and is what Electron loads at runtime.
- **Python CLI (`simple_recorder.py`, ~2.9k lines, ~60 click commands)** is the single entry point bundled by `stenoai.spec`. Sub-modules in `src/`: `audio_recorder` (sounddevice), `transcriber` (pywhispercpp), `summarizer` (Ollama HTTP client), `ollama_manager` (lifecycle of the bundled `ollama serve`), `config` (JSON-backed user settings + model registry), `folders`, `models`, `whisper_models`.
- **State across CLI invocations** is persisted to `recorder_state.json` and similar small JSON files — there is no daemon. Long-running recordings are a `record` subprocess kept alive by the Electron main process.
- **User data lives in `~/Library/Application Support/stenoai/`** (`recordings/`, `transcripts/`, `output/`), resolved via `src.config.get_data_dirs()`. Repo-root `recordings/`/`transcripts/`/`output/` dirs are dev-only scratch.
- **Bundled binaries (`bin/`)**: Ollama + ffmpeg, downloaded by `scripts/download-ollama.sh`. PyInstaller copies them into `dist/stenoai/ollama/` and `dist/stenoai/ffmpeg`. Electron then re-bundles `dist/stenoai/` as an `extraResource`. `bin/steno-diarize` (macOS only) is a separate Swift/CoreML sidecar built by `scripts/build-diarize-sidecar.sh` — see "Speaker diarization" below.
- **Deep links**: app registers the `stenoai://` URL scheme. Handler logic is in `app/main.js` near `SHORTCUT_PROTOCOL`. Used by macOS Shortcuts: `stenoai://record/start?name=...` and `stenoai://record/stop`.

## Development Commands

### Backend (Python)
- Build the bundled backend: `source venv/bin/activate && pyinstaller stenoai.spec --noconfirm`
- Inspect CLI surface: `dist/stenoai/stenoai --help`
- Most relevant CLI commands for debugging: `status`, `setup-check`, `list_failed`, `reprocess path/to/summary.json`, `query transcript.txt`, `pipeline filename.wav`
- Ad-hoc Python lint: `ruff check .`
- Enforced Python lint ratchet: `python -m pip install -r requirements-lint.txt && python scripts/ruff_ratchet.py`
- Intentionally update the reviewed ratchet baseline: `python scripts/ruff_ratchet.py --update`
- Run all tests: `python -m unittest discover tests`
- Run a single test: `python -m unittest tests.test_config.ConfigStoragePathTests.test_set_storage_path_handles_permission_errors`

### Desktop App (Electron)
- Start app (dev): `cd app && npm start` — rebuilds the renderer (`vite build`), then launches Electron
- Start without rebuilding renderer: `cd app && npm run start:nobuild` — fast relaunch when only `main.js` / `preload.js` changed
- Renderer dev server (HMR, no Electron): `cd app && npm run dev:renderer`
- Typecheck renderer: `cd app && npm run typecheck:renderer`
- Lint renderer: `cd app && npm run lint:renderer`
- Lint Electron main process: `cd app && npm run lint:main`
- Format renderer: `cd app && npm run format:renderer`
- Build DMG (local, for testing): `cd app && npm run build`

The Electron build pulls the bundled backend from `../dist/stenoai` via `extraResources`, so the PyInstaller step (`pyinstaller stenoai.spec --noconfirm`) must succeed *before* `npm run build` — otherwise the packaged app will be missing `stenoai`, `ollama`, and `ffmpeg`. The same applies in dev: `getBackendPath()` falls back to `dist/stenoai/stenoai`, so a fresh checkout needs the backend built once before the app can record or transcribe.

For setup from a clean checkout, see `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md`.

### Speaker diarization (macOS only)
Per-channel acoustic speaker diarization (splitting multiple speakers sharing
one side of a call — e.g. two people around one mic, or multiple remote
participants on system audio) runs through `bin/steno-diarize`, a Swift/
CoreML sidecar (`diarize-sidecar/`) wrapping FluidAudio's diarizers —
Sortformer (default) or Nemotron 3, an 8-speaker streaming model (streaming
preset via `STENOAI_DIARIZE_NEMOTRON_PRESET`, default `c128-split-w8a8`, the
100%-ANE-resident split-graph build). The user picks the engine in
Settings -> Transcribe ("Speaker detection"), persisted as the
`diarization_engine` config key; `src.transcriber._steno_diarize_env()`
turns it into the sidecar's `STENOAI_DIARIZE_ENGINE` for every invocation
(`diarize`, `model-status`, `prepare-models`), and an already-set
`STENOAI_DIARIZE_ENGINE` still wins as a developer override. Because
meeting processing never downloads models, `set-diarization-engine` refuses
a non-default engine until its models are ready; the renderer prepares them
first via `prepare-speaker-models --engine nemotron3`. The stdout JSON contract is
identical for both engines, so Python never branches on engine.
Invoked from Python (`src.transcriber._run_steno_diarize`) — never
from Electron, since the batch pipeline is entirely Python-orchestrated.
Build it *before* `pyinstaller stenoai.spec`, same as `download-ollama.sh`:

```
scripts/build-diarize-sidecar.sh   # outputs bin/steno-diarize
scripts/download-ollama.sh
pyinstaller stenoai.spec --noconfirm
```

`stenoai.spec` bundles `bin/steno-diarize` only when it exists and only on
macOS (`_IS_DARWIN`). A local development build may omit it and falls back
to legacy channel-only "You"/"Others" labeling. A macOS release build must
build it first and assert both `bin/steno-diarize` and the bundled copy are
executable; the release workflows enforce those checks. A failed individual
diarization run still falls back without failing the meeting. Windows/Linux
never get acoustic diarization;
`_resolve_steno_diarize()` returns `None` immediately off-darwin.

FluidAudio models are prepared explicitly during macOS onboarding with
`prepare-speaker-models` and checked without writes via `speaker-model-status`.
Normal meeting processing never downloads or repairs these models: the Swift
sidecar enables FluidAudio's offline-only mode before loading them and falls
back to channel labels when the cache is unavailable. The cache lives below
the Steno user-data directory and therefore honors `STENOAI_USER_DATA_DIR` in
tests; `STENOAI_DIARIZE_MODEL_DIR` is the lower-level sidecar override.

### End-to-end tests (Playwright)
The e2e suite drives the **real Electron app** (real window, real clicks) to catch
full-app regressions like the org-provider reset before they reach users. It lives
at repo-root `e2e/` (config, fixtures, specs); run it from `app/`.

**Standing rule — keep coverage current:** when you add or materially change a
user-facing feature, add or update its e2e spec in the **same** change. Prefer a
model-free T2 spec that drives the `window.stenoai.<group>` preload bridge and
asserts backend state on disk (config/files/JSON), using the existing specs +
`e2e/fixtures/` helpers as templates — only reach for a UI/T1 spec when the
interaction itself is the risk, and keep model/network-bearing assertions in the
`@pipeline`/nightly lanes. This applies to agent-built work too: this file
overrides an agent's own test-level defaults.

- Run the whole suite: `cd app && npm run test:e2e` (needs the renderer built and,
  for T2, the backend bundle at `dist/stenoai/`).
- Run one tier: `cd app && npm run test:e2e -- --project=t1` (or `t2`).
- Tiers are chosen by spec filename:
  - **T1 — `*.t1.spec.ts`**: renderer-only with mock IPC (`STENOAI_E2E_MOCK_IPC=1`,
    stubs in `app/e2e-mock-ipc.js`). No Python/Ollama/network — fully hermetic.
  - **T2 — `*.t2.spec.ts`**: the real bundled backend + mock org adapter / Ollama
    (`e2e/fixtures/`). Proves end-to-end wiring.
  - **`@pipeline` (a T2 spec)**: the transcription→summarize smoke drives a synthetic
    WAV through the real pipeline and asserts HEARTBEAT + a summary written. The engine is
    env-selected (`STENOAI_E2E_ENGINE`): **parakeet** locally (the Mac-divergent path) but
    **whisper** in CI — GitHub-hosted macOS runners have no Metal GPU, so parakeet-mlx can't
    load there. Models aren't bundled (download on use), so it's tagged `@pipeline` and split
    out: `--grep @pipeline` runs it (CI's `t2-pipeline-macos` job caches a whisper model),
    `--grep-invert @pipeline` keeps the other T2 specs model-free. A dev machine without the
    active engine's model **skips** it (loudly) rather than failing.
  - **`@perf` (a T1 spec)**: `live-transcript-perf.t1` is a measurement harness, not a
    gate - it drives paced synthetic partials into the live transcript panel and reports
    per-tick script/style/layout cost (CDP `Performance.getMetrics`), retained heap after a
    forced GC, and DOM node count against a growing segment list. CI excludes it
    (`--grep-invert @perf`) because wall-clock work on a shared runner is not something to
    block a PR on. Run it before **and** after any change to live-transcript rendering:
    `cd app && npm run test:e2e -- --project=t1 --grep @perf`. Pace matters - fired
    back-to-back the ticks get batched into one React render and the measurement silently
    collapses; the harness paces one per animation frame and counts DOM writes to prove it.
  - **Current specs:** `org-lock.t1`, `shared-notes-policy.t1`, `live-transcript-lanes.t1`
    (the live panel's rendering contract: a partial is replaced in place per speaker, a
    final retires it, a late final sorts into place, and the Resumed divider - driven
    through the real `live-transcript-chunk` channel via `e2e/fixtures/live-transcript.ts`),
    `org-lock-lifecycle.t2`,
    `config-corruption.t2`, the core-loop trio `recording-lifecycle.t2` /
    `meetings-crud.t2` / `folders-crud.t2`, the config trio `settings-roundtrip.t2` /
    `ai-provider.t2` / `model-management.t2`, and the chat/org pair `chat-sessions.t2`
    (local session persistence) / `org-crud.t2` (meeting CRUD + share/unshare + ai-chat
    against the stateful `mock-adapter.js`), plus `summarize-contract.t2` (a
    deterministic `@contract` driving `reprocess` through the capturing
    `mock-ollama.js` to assert the summariser's prompt-build + response-parse — no
    ASR, no real model), and the calendar/notifications pair `calendar-auth.t2`
    (auth-status from a local token file + auto-detect-meetings toggle) /
    `notifications.t2` (the notifications_enabled toggle gating the note-ready /
    silence notifications via the `shown` signal), `diarization-engine.t2` (the
    Speaker detection setting: Sortformer default, a non-default engine refused
    while its models are missing, IPC allowlist; its UI half, the
    download-then-save picker, is `diarization-engine.t1`), and the onboarding spec
    `setup-check.t2` (the setup-wizard allGood + checks contract) (all model-free,
    run in `t2-macos` /
    `t2-windows`); `transcription-pipeline.t2` and `honest-failure.t2` (tagged
    `@pipeline`, run in `t2-pipeline-macos` / `t2-pipeline-windows`), and
    `speaker-diarization.t2` (also `@pipeline`, macOS-only — skips loudly off-darwin
    and when macOS's `say` TTS is unavailable — synthesizes real speech via `say` so
    Parakeet/whisper.cpp produce real ASR segments, points
    `STENOAI_DIARIZE_SIDECAR_PATH` at a fixture script returning fixed 2-speaker JSON,
    and asserts the saved transcript's per-channel "You"/"Speaker 2"/"Others" labeling
    and cross-channel numbering; the real `steno-diarize`/Sortformer binary itself was
    validated directly against real recordings rather than in CI). Engine selection
    for `@pipeline` specs is shared via `e2e/fixtures/engine.ts`; model-free T2 setup
    helpers (deterministic recording config + seeded meeting summaries) live in
    `e2e/fixtures/user-config.ts`. The core-loop specs drive the preload IPC bridge and
    assert backend state on disk — `recording-lifecycle` exercises the
    start/pause/resume/stop state machine via the renderer-driven (no-device, no-model)
    path and skips loudly where `isSystemAudioSupported()` is false. The config trio
    asserts get/set round-trips persist to the right `config.json` keys (settings),
    the provider matrix + encrypted cloud key (ai-provider), and the deterministic
    model list/status/set surface (model-management) — pulls stay in `@pipeline`.
  - **Windows T2:** the same specs run on `windows-latest` via explicit per-OS jobs
    (`build-backend-windows` → `t2-windows` / `t2-pipeline-windows`). Differences from the
    macOS jobs: no exec-bit restore (Windows has no exec bit), `taskkill`/`Stop-Process`
    instead of `pkill`, and the `@pipeline` job uses the REAL parakeet path —
    `STENOAI_E2E_ENGINE=parakeet` runs onnx-asr on CPU (no Metal needed), caching the
    `models--istupakov--parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-onnx` HF snapshot. org-lock T2 may **skip** on
    Windows (safeStorage/DPAPI on a headless runner), acceptable while non-blocking.
  - **T3 — `*.t3.spec.ts` (nightly only):** the heavy `@long-meeting` chunking smoke. Drives a
    multi-minute WAV (`STENOAI_E2E_LONG_WAV_SECONDS`, default 1200) through the real
    **parakeet** windowing path (`PARAKEET_CHUNK_DURATION_S` = 60 s, a hard constant) and
    asserts the pipeline completes. parakeet-only — whisper.cpp doesn't use that path; it
    `skip`s on whisper. Exercises the long-file chunking **plumbing**, NOT the MLX/Metal OOM
    (that needs a GPU runner — tracked follow-up). Too slow for per-PR, so it lives in the
    nightly workflow, not `e2e.yml`.
- **Isolation keystone:** every test sets `STENOAI_USER_DATA_DIR` to a temp dir, which
  both `getUserDataDir()` (main.js) and `get_user_data_dir()` (`src/config.py`) honor,
  so a test can never read/write the real `~/Library/Application Support/stenoai`. The
  launch fixture (`e2e/fixtures/electron.ts`) waits on `[data-app-ready]` (no fixed timeouts)
  and force-kills the app process tree if a graceful close hangs on teardown (Windows).
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs per PR. T1 on Ubuntu/xvfb plus the macOS T2 and
  pipeline jobs are required checks for `main`; Windows T2 remains advisory.
  The protected T1 job runs the privacy scan, Electron main-process ESLint and the pinned
  Ruff ratchet as unconditional steps, so any of those failures makes the required T1 check fail.
  `.github/workflows/e2e-nightly.yml` (scheduled) reuses that suite via
  `workflow_call` for flake/drift detection and adds the T3 long-meeting job. A CI-only
  Playwright `globalSetup` kills a stray Ollama + waits for a clean 11434 before the run.

## Interface copy and i18n

The app ships English-only today, but the groundwork is gated so that adding a language
stays a matter of adding a locale file rather than rebuilding the interface.

**Why the gate exists.** An i18n migration rewrites hundreds of hardcoded strings into
`t()` lookups. That edit is supposed to be pure motion — same words, new home. In practice
it is where copy changes silently: an attempt at this rewrote `Nothing to process` into
`Nothing was recorded.` in passing, three e2e specs went red, and nothing in the diff said
why. Roughly two thirds of this app's copy is asserted by no test at all, so the same slip
elsewhere would land unseen.

**Two checks, run per PR (`npm run lint:i18n`, `npm run i18n:inventory`):**

- **No new hardcoded copy.** `renderer/eslint.config.i18n.mjs` runs
  `i18next/no-literal-string` plus the local interpolated-template rule at `error` over
  JSX text and the copy-bearing attributes -
  the DOM ones (`placeholder`, `title`, `alt`, `aria-label`) and this app's own component
  props (`label`, `description`, `hint`, `confirmLabel`, …), which carry ~170 sites of
  visible copy. It is a *separate* config from
  `eslint.config.mjs` on purpose: a codebase with no i18n yet trips it hundreds of times,
  and folding those 751 into the main lint run would make it permanently red - which this repo
  has already seen end in four react-hooks rules downgraded to `warn`, where they are now
  write-only. Instead `app/scripts/i18n-lint-gate.mjs` compares per-file counts against
  `renderer/i18n-lint-baseline.json` and fails on any divergence, in both directions: a
  higher count is new hardcoded copy, a lower one is progress that should be committed
  (`npm run lint:i18n:update`) so the burn-down number stays honest.
  The companion rule is intentionally syntax-only: it follows direct JSX expressions,
  transparent conditional/type wrappers, and direct literal/template ReactNode values,
  then stops at functions, callbacks, helpers, and other calls. That keeps the blocking
  rule precise; broader rendered-copy paths belong to the inventory ratchet below.
- **The English copy inventory.** `app/scripts/i18n-copy-inventory.mjs` extracts every
  English string the renderer shows into `docs/i18n/copy-inventory.json` (1220 `copy` +
  1175 `uncertain`, repeated copy recorded per occurrence). Interpolations use stable
  `{{…}}` placeholders so expression renames do not create copy churn. It blocks nothing; it
  witnesses. The review rule for an i18n migration is then one sentence: *the inventory
  diff must show strings moving, never changing.* Afterwards it keeps working as a copy
  changelog — an intentional wording change shows up as a one-file diff in the PR that
  makes it.

  In particular, the inventory covers callback returns, nested/filtered maps, helper
  calls, indirect ReactNode props such as `action`, and property-access callbacks. Those
  paths are deliberately outside the custom ESLint rule, but changing their wording still
  makes the checked-in inventory stale and therefore fails `npm run i18n:inventory`.

  Its burden of proof is **inverted** relative to the linter, and that asymmetry is the
  design. The linter blocks, so a false positive costs a contributor time and a noisy rule
  gets downgraded — precision wins, an allowlist is right. The inventory only witnesses, so
  a false positive is one extra line in a generated file while a false negative is a string
  that can be reworded with nothing to notice — recall wins. An earlier version got this
  backwards and used an allowlist of copy *shapes*; three review rounds each found it
  dropping different real copy (`All notes`, `AI`, `note`/`notes`, `Ask AI`, `Re-run
  first-time setup`), because such a list has to enumerate every shape English can take.
  Now a string is recorded unless **provably** not copy: AST position decides most of it,
  and a reject list handles what position cannot (`const cls = 'flex items-center'` and
  `const heading = 'Nothing to process'` sit in identical positions). Entries split into
  `copy` — the contract a migration must hold — and `uncertain`, the recall safety net, so
  a styling PR that only moves `uncertain` lines is a quick read.

**e2e selectors stay in English — that is a feature.** 25 specs match on English copy
(`getByRole('button', { name: 'Delete' })` and friends). Do not convert them to
`data-testid`: they are the runtime half of the baseline oracle, and they are what caught
the rewrite above. `e2e/fixtures/electron.ts` pins `STENOAI_UI_LANGUAGE=en` for the whole
suite so they are deterministic regardless of the host's OS locale or a stored preference.
Per-language coverage belongs in one dedicated locale-smoke spec (switch language, assert
a handful of translated strings, assert no raw dotted keys leak into the UI), not in
translating existing specs.

`COPY_ATTRIBUTES` is an allowlist, so `i18n-gate.test.mjs` carries a **tripwire**: it walks
every JSX prop name the renderer actually uses and fails if a copy-sounding one
(`label`, `caption`, `hint`, …) is classified in neither `COPY_ATTRIBUTES` nor
`KNOWN_NON_COPY_ATTRIBUTES`. An allowlist is acceptable exactly when its gaps are
mechanically detectable.

One gap is deliberate and covered by the other half: swapping a literal for a different
one inside the same file leaves the per-file count unchanged, so `lint:i18n` stays green.
That is the copy-rewrite case, and `i18n:inventory` fails on it — the two checks are built
to cover each other rather than to duplicate each other.

**What the gate does not catch,** so nobody mistakes green for complete: strings assembled
at runtime from fragments, copy in the Electron main process (menus, tray, native
dialogs), user-facing text emitted by the Python CLI, date and number formatting, and
translation quality. The linter also cannot see a plain TypeScript literal that is later
rendered — `const heading = 'Nothing to process'` — which is precisely why the inventory
casts a wider net than the linter.


## Production Readiness
This app ships as a signed DMG to real users. Before considering any change complete:
- **Packaged app test**: Dev mode (`npm start`) is not sufficient. Always rebuild the DMG (`npm run build`) and test the installed app from `/Applications`.
- **Cold start test**: Kill all background processes (`pkill -f ollama`) and launch the app fresh. The full pipeline (record, transcribe, summarize) must work with no pre-existing services running.
- **No shelling out to bundled binaries for operations that have an HTTP/library API**. macOS SIP + Electron hardened runtime strips `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` from child processes. Use the `ollama` Python package (HTTP API) for model operations, not `subprocess.run([ollama_path, ...])`. The only acceptable use of the Ollama binary is `ollama serve` (starting the server), which is covered by the `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` entitlement.
- **No bare `exit()` in Python code**. PyInstaller bundles don't have `exit` as a builtin. Always use `sys.exit()`.

## Cross-Platform (macOS + Windows)
The app ships on **macOS** (primary, signed + notarised DMG) **and Windows** (alpha, NSIS installer). **Any change to shared code must be considered for both platforms** — a fix for one can silently break or regress the other. The macOS build is the stable, signed one; never let a Windows fix change it.

- **Gate platform-specific code on `process.platform`** (JS) / `sys.platform` (Python). Don't apply a platform-only change globally. Examples of macOS-only things that must be gated: `titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'` + traffic-light insets (the 82px `sb-top` / toggle offset, behind `html.is-mac`), the `services`/`hide`/`unhide` menu roles, `forceCoreAudioTap`, `app.dock`/dock-icon APIs, `askForMediaAccess`. Windows-only: `windowsHide` on spawns, `setAppUserModelId`, `taskkill` tree-kill, the explicit `BrowserWindow` icon.
- **electron-builder config is per-platform.** `asar: false` lives in the `win` block only — macOS keeps `asar` (its signing/notarisation integrity depends on it). Put platform-specific build options in the `mac`/`win` blocks, not top-level.
- **Paths must be cross-platform.** Use `os.pathsep` (not `:`), `src.config.get_user_data_dir()` (Python) and `getUserDataDir()` (main.js) — never hardcode `~/Library/Application Support/...`. The `.exe` suffix + `shutil.which` for bundled binaries.
- **Transcription backend dispatches by platform**: macOS uses `parakeet-mlx` (Apple Silicon GPU); Windows/Linux use `onnx-asr` (ONNX Runtime, CPU) — both behind `src/parakeet.py`. Call sites must not branch on engine. Windows is CPU-only today (slower; DirectML is a tracked follow-up).
- **PyInstaller spec (`stenoai.spec`) is conditional per `sys.platform`** — MLX hidden-imports/dylibs on darwin, onnx-asr + `copy_metadata('onnx-asr')` + onnxruntime DLLs off-darwin; UPX off and Ollama GPU libs pruned on Windows. Keep new bundling additions gated so they don't bloat or break the other platform's bundle.
- **Verify both.** Windows is built + smoke-tested in CI (`.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`, includes `onnx-selftest`); macOS via `build-release.yml`. When you can't test the other platform locally, at minimum confirm the change is correctly gated.

## Brand Colors
Paper + ink — a cream page with deep ink text. The logo
(`website/public/stenoai-logo.svg`) is `#1B1B19` ink on `#FAF9F5` paper.
There is no chromatic brand accent; UI accents (focus rings, active
states, links) use the foreground ink itself, so the whole interface
reads as one neutral palette.

**Light mode**
- Page / surface: `#FAF9F5` (paper-0)
- Sunken / hover: `#F5F3EC` (paper-1)
- Primary text + accent: `#1B1B19` (ink-900)
- Secondary text: `#6B6B66` (ink-500)

**Dark mode**
- Page / surface: `#1A1A18`
- Raised: `#24241F`
- Primary text + accent: `#EDEAE0`
- Secondary text: `#9A968A`

Tokens live in `app/renderer/src/globals.css` under `:root` (light) and
`.dark, [data-theme="dark"]` (dark). Prefer the semantic tokens
(`--fg-1`, `--surface-raised`, `--accent-primary`) over raw hex.

## Git Workflow
- Always create a branch for changes unless explicitly told otherwise
- Never commit directly to `main`
- Before creating a PR, run a self-review of the full branch diff (`git diff main...HEAD`):
  - Review backend code for security issues, error handling gaps, edge cases, and best practices
  - Review frontend code for layout bugs, CSS consistency, accessibility, and polish
  - Put UI changes through a design pass too, not just a correctness one
  - Categorize findings by severity (critical/medium/low) and fix critical issues before merging

### How much process a change earns (guideline, not a mandate)
Match the rigor to the change — don't run the heavyweight loop on a one-line edit.
- **New features, risky changes, wide-blast-radius refactors**: build it, then put the
  full branch diff through a real review pass (a multi-agent panel, a second model, or
  a human) before opening the PR. This is the work that earns the extra round.
- **Mechanical refactors, dead-code cleanup, copy/docs**: implement, run
  test/typecheck, exercise the runtime surface if there is one, then PR.
- **Whoever wrote the code shouldn't be the one to sign it off.** When an agent wrote
  it, have a different model or a human review the diff. Shared blind spots are exactly
  the ones that survive self-review.
- **Every PR, whatever its size**: take it to green-and-reviewed. Evaluate bot and human
  comments critically: fix the real issues, push back with reasons on the wrong ones.
  Stop at green; a human merges.
- **Show the evidence.** Don't report a check as passing without having run it, and say
  which failures are caused by the change versus pre-existing, environmental, or flaky.

The maintainer drives this with a private agent crew (`luffy` for the build-and-review
loop, `nami` for taking a PR to green). Those aren't part of this repo, so use whatever
tooling you have. The workflow above is the portable part.

## Git Commit Guidelines
- Do NOT include "Generated with Claude Code" attribution in commit messages
- Do NOT include "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" in commit messages
- Keep commit messages concise and focused on what changed
- Use conventional commit format when appropriate (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

## Release Process
Releases are automated via `.github/workflows/build-release.yml`. Never create releases manually. The full checklist for shipping a new version (do all of this before pushing the tag — the tag push is the public release trigger):

1. **Survey what's shipping** — `git log v<previous>..HEAD --oneline` and `gh pr list --state merged --limit 20` to confirm the changeset.
2. **Update the README** to reflect what's shipping:
   - Add bullet entries to the "📢 What's New" section for each notable user-facing change. Format: `- **YYYY-MM-DD** <emoji> <Title> — <one-sentence description>`. Most recent entries at the top.
   - Keep only the **most recent 4 entries** in the section — trim older ones as you add new ones, regardless of date. The section is a rolling marquee, not a changelog.
   - Update the "Features" list if any new user-facing capability is being added (or an existing one materially changed).
   - Update "Models & Performance" if the bundled Whisper or Ollama model lineup changed.
3. **Update `docs/changelog.mdx`** (the public docs changelog page) with a new `<Update label="v<version>" description="<Month DD, YYYY>">` block, grouped under `**New**` / `**Improved**` / `**Fixed**` / `**Known Issues**` as applicable — same source list as the README bullets, but every entry gets its own line here (not trimmed to 4).
   - **Copy-review pass before merging:** re-read every bullet for readability, not just accuracy. Rewrite any sentence that:
     - buries the actual instruction after multiple clauses (put the action first: "Turn off X to do Y" beats "Do Y, whenever ..., turn off X");
     - has a trailing modifier or restatement that makes you re-read it (drop "with X hidden"-style tails; don't restate the same point twice, e.g. "...so it can be reprocessed -- it's never lost");
     - uses a pronoun with no clear antecedent ("turn it on" referring to something not named in the sentence);
     - is vague about what actually broke ("Fixed an issue choosing X" → "Fixed an issue that could prevent choosing X").
   - Each bullet should read as one clear clause on first pass. If in doubt, read it aloud.
4. **Bump version** in `app/package.json`.
5. **Commit and merge** the README + changelog + version bump to `main` (or push directly if explicitly authorised).
6. **Draft release notes** as markdown — they become the GitHub Release body verbatim:
   - One-line summary at the top.
   - Headline features grouped under `### Section` headers (e.g., "System audio", "UX polish", "Under the hood", "Fixes").
   - Migration/upgrade notes if anything changed paths, identifiers, defaults, or requires user action.
   - A `### Thanks to our contributors` section crediting everyone with a merged PR since the last tag — derive the list with `git shortlog -sne v<previous>..HEAD`, resolve each to their GitHub @handle (`gh pr list --state merged --json number,author,mergedAt`), and @-mention them so they're linked and notified in the release body. Credit the external contributors (the maintainer running the release need not self-credit).
   - Apply the same copy-review pass as step 3 — these notes are public-facing too.
7. **Run the release gate (blocks the tag).** Push a `release/v<version>` branch — `git push origin main:refs/heads/release/v0.3.0` — to trigger `.github/workflows/e2e-release-gate.yml`, which runs the full e2e matrix (T1 + macOS/Windows T2 + `@pipeline` + the `@long-meeting` T3 smoke). **Do not create the tag until this run is green.** The gate runs on the branch, before the immutable tag exists, so a failure is fixed-and-re-pushed rather than leaving a half-released tag. (You can also dry-run it via `workflow_dispatch`.) `build-release.yml` additionally runs a fast T1 backstop smoke (`gate-smoke`) before signing, but that is defense-in-depth — the branch gate is the real signal.
8. **Create an annotated tag** on `main` with the release notes as the tag message. **Always pass `--cleanup=whitespace`** — without it, `git tag -F` strips every line starting with `#`, which silently deletes Markdown `### Section` headers from the release body:
   ```
   git tag -a v0.3.0 --cleanup=whitespace -F /path/to/notes.md
   git push origin v0.3.0
   ```
   (If using `-m` instead of `-F`, pass `--cleanup=whitespace` anyway — the comment-stripping default applies to both.)
9. The tag push triggers the workflow which:
   - Builds signed + notarized DMGs for both arm64 and x64
   - Creates a GitHub Release with the tag message as the body
   - Uploads both DMGs as release assets
   - Posts a release announcement to Discord (summary + a few headline features + the contributor thank-you), via the `Announce release on Discord` step (`scripts/discord-release-announce.mjs`). This is automatic and requires no manual Discord post. It no-ops unless the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` repo secret is set (an incoming webhook for the announcements channel), and is `continue-on-error` so a Discord hiccup never fails the release.
10. Do NOT build DMGs locally for releases, do NOT use `gh release create` manually. Do NOT post the Discord release announcement by hand — the workflow does it.

## Session Logging
When the user says "log session" or similar (e.g., "update session log", "document this session"):
1. Update SESSION_LOG.md in the root directory with the current session details
2. Include: date/time, summary of work, key decisions, files modified, issues resolved, next steps
3. REPLACE or CONDENSE previous session entries to keep the file concise (max 2-3 most recent sessions)
4. Keep only relevant context for the next Claude session - remove outdated or completed work details
5. Format with clear headers and organized sections
