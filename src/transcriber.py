"""Batch transcription via Parakeet TDT v3 (MLX).

Replaces the previous pywhispercpp + openai-whisper backends. One engine
for live (in simple_recorder.py's VAD-gated consumer) and post-stop
(here), which means a recording's live transcript and final transcript
share the same model — no flavour mismatch between what the user saw
during recording and what summarisation sees afterwards.

Public surface kept compatible with the prior whisper-era pipeline so
the rest of the codebase doesn't churn:

* ``WhisperTranscriber`` (class name retained for callers / tests)
  - ``transcribe_audio(path, language)`` — single-channel batch
  - ``transcribe_diarised(path, language)`` — stereo channel split into
    [You] / [Others] turns
  - ``transcribe_with_timestamps(path)`` — segment-level timing

The stereo channel split, RMS-energy gating, and speaker-bleed collapse
all stay — they operate on transcript text + audio metadata, not on the
specific ASR engine. Split channels keep their original relative volume for
bleed checks; separate loudness-normalised copies are sent to ASR.

Whisper-era hallucination filtering ("Thank you." / "Bye." on silence)
is gone: Parakeet doesn't produce those canned phrases on silent or
noisy input (verified empirically — pure silence, low noise, and
isolated clicks all return empty). Filtering by phrase against a real
ASR engine would now strictly remove real speech without preventing
anything; the model is the source of truth.

# echo. For each system_segment we find the nearest mic_segment by start
# time within ±PER_SEGMENT_BLEED_WINDOW_S and drop it if Jaccard exceeds

# would silently disable bleed correction for Chinese / Japanese /

    matching what subprocess.run's own communicate() does internally to
    avoid the classic pipe-deadlock (stdout payloads have measured up to
    ~211KB in production, well past an OS pipe buffer, so neither stream

    one-off/manual invocation into GPU instead of the sidecar's own

    diarizer cluster id that produced this segment (e.g. "SPEAKER_2"), or
    None when diarization wasn't available/used at all (the legacy
    single-speaker fallback). Carried through so callers can persist exact
    per-line speaker provenance in the saved transcript's sidecar, instead
    of a relabeling pass having to reconstruct "which cluster produced
    this line" after the fact via fuzzy timestamp matching -- the fuzzy
    approach is provably unsafe (see src.speaker_suggestions.relabel_transcript_exact
    and the plan doc's Phase 8): a channel's cluster segments routinely
    span nearly the whole recording, so timestamp-tolerance matching can
    misattribute a line to the wrong cluster, or even the wrong channel.

    Tries acoustic diarization first: if the steno-diarize sidecar succeeds
    and finds more than one real speaker cluster, turns are built from the
    diarizer's own segment boundaries (with ASR sentences reassigned into
    them via _assign_asr_segments_to_diar_segments). The cluster with the
    most total speaking time keeps the channel's legacy label
    ("You"/"Others"). Other clusters get a placeholder resolved to
    "Speaker N" later, except short minority clusters in a dominant channel,
    which fold into the dominant label. A self voiceprint can re-anchor the
    legacy label onto a different eligible cluster instead (see
    _apply_voiceprint_matches; mic channel only). NAMED
    (non-self) speaker identification does not happen automatically here —
    see src.speaker_suggestions for the human-confirmed suggestion flow.
    ANY failure — missing binary, timeout, bad JSON, a single-cluster
    result, or any voiceprint-matching failure — falls back to the
    byte-identical legacy behaviour of labeling every ASR segment with
    legacy_label.

    If diarization succeeds and ``clusters_out`` is given (a mutable dict),
    it's populated in place with this channel's raw cluster/embedding data
    (build_clusters_from_diarization's shape) so the caller can assemble a
    {stem}_speakers.json sidecar from data already computed here, without
    a second diarization pass (previously only backfill-speaker-embeddings
    -- a separate, manual CLI step re-diarizing from scratch -- ever wrote
