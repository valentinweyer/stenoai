Simple Audio Recorder & Transcriber for Electron App

Backend script that handles:
1. Transcribing captured audio with Whisper/Parakeet
2. Summarizing with Ollama
3. Saving everything locally

Audio capture is done in the Electron renderer (Web Audio); this backend
transcribes/summarizes the resulting file. Usage (called by Electron):
    python simple_recorder.py process-streaming recording.webm --name "Session"
    python simple_recorder.py transcribe-stream   # live partials over stdin
    python simple_recorder.py process-streaming recording.wav --name "Session"

    inside transcription, so by the time a path reaches its own `return`

    so, no error, and no way to recover the embeddings afterwards -- the
    diarization itself ran normally and the transcript carried its speaker
    labels, so nothing on screen suggested anything had been lost.

    Deliberately NOT called from the continue-recording (`append_to`) path.
    That path folds a segment into an EXISTING note, and this sidecar is

    writing there produces exactly the orphaned sidecar that has to be

    """VAD-gated batch transcription pipeline for ONE audio channel (mic or
    system) of the live-transcript consumer.

    Replaces the earlier parakeet-mlx streaming approach with the
    Granola / OpenOats / Meetily pattern: Silero VAD detects utterance
    boundaries; each closed utterance is batch-transcribed by Parakeet
    for a stable, finalised segment. While speech is in progress, a
    throttled re-transcribe of the trailing few seconds emits a partial
    so the user sees text forming in real time without flicker between
    unrelated decoder hypotheses.

    Two independent instances are driven by ``_live_stdin_consumer`` (see
    ``create_pair()``) — one per channel, each with its own Silero VAD
    state — so speaker identity comes from which channel actually
    contains the speech, not a post-hoc RMS guess on a pre-mixed mono
    stream. ``process()`` itself is channel-agnostic; it only touches this
    instance's own state.

    Protocol emitted on stdout (unchanged from earlier streaming consumer
    so main.js / preload / ipc.ts wiring is reused, plus a new `speaker`
    field):

      LIVE_READY:<config json>     once, after both models are loaded
      LIVE_SEG:<segment json>      per partial OR final; carries "speaker"
      LIVE_ERROR:<error json>      on any unrecoverable failure

    Partials are emitted directly (``_emit`` → stdout, no delay). Finals
    are NOT emitted directly — ``_finalise`` hands them to a shared
    ``_PendingFinalsCoordinator`` so a same-instant utterance on the other
    channel can be checked for bleed before either reaches the user; see
    ``_live_stdin_consumer``.

    Architecture notes:
      * Audio is consumed at 16 kHz mono float32, already split to this
        channel by the caller (the combined stdin stream is interleaved
        stereo; ``_live_stdin_consumer`` de-interleaves before calling
        ``process()``). The pipeline itself doesn't resample or split.
      * Preroll ring holds the most recent ``PREROLL_CHUNKS`` chunks of
        pre-speech audio so the first syllable of every utterance is
        recovered after VAD fires (Silero always trips slightly late).
      * Partials see the trailing ``PARTIAL_WINDOW_S`` of the utterance.
        At 15 s, a 4-5 sentence monologue stays fully visible in the live
        bubble (the prior 5 s window meant the rolling view dropped
        earlier sentences off-screen during continuous speech). Parakeet
        decodes 15 s in ~150-250 ms on Apple Silicon, comfortably under
        the 400 ms partial interval. Going wider (e.g. matching MAX at
        30 s) would risk decode time creeping past the interval and
        back-pressuring the stdin pipe.
      * Final fires on Silero's SpeechEnd OR when the utterance hits
        ``MAX_UTTERANCE_S`` so a monologue still produces output.

    # decode on a fanless M1 Air vs the 400 ms interval → ~94 % of partials
    # over budget, audio backing up across the recording). Partials are
    # best-effort display only — finals accumulate every sample regardless —
    # so when decode is slow we stretch the *effective* partial cadence to an
    # EWMA of measured decode time, dropping the partials that would otherwise
    # queue up while always draining stdin. On fast machines (decode ≪ the

    #     measurements) is fully covered; continuous cross-talk on a fanless
    #     Air is the residual gap, bounded by the stdin queue on the JS side.
    #   * The EWMA only samples when a partial actually decodes, and its ALPHA

    what the resulting voiceprint will actually be compared against. Falls

    to show one sentence in a delete confirmation, on a path where a slow
    or failing check must never stand between a user and deleting their
    own recording.

    Why it exists: a CONFIRMED person survives deleting the meeting (their
    prototype lives in config.json's person_profiles, bound to no meeting
    -- verified against a real library, where 5 of 19 working prototypes
    came from meetings deleted long ago). An UNNAMED cluster does not
    survive it, and cannot be recovered afterwards by any means: naming a
    voice requires hearing it, hearing it requires the source audio, and
    the delete takes the audio. So the last moment at which an unnamed
    cluster can still be named is just before the delete -- which is
    exactly when nobody is thinking about it.

    Reports `success: true` with zero counts for a meeting that has no
    sidecar at all (not diarized, or diarized before sidecars existed):
    nothing is at risk there, and a caller deciding whether to show a

       to append instead of replace. Keeps the oldest.
